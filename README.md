<h1># 100_days_of_Python</h1>

this is A <b>bootcamp</b> course from Udemy that you can find [HERE](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM3@jEkBpX28v0IVYAuJ-cXM5RLMDgdushNgyMr9yA-K2js6CnQnAbdoZM2gX02gznFKug==/)

I am doing this along side of some other stuff for a #100DaysOfCode Challenge, I dropped the ball and got side tracked on day 3, and spent day 3-6 working on a file sorting system, so now
my days are all messed up, but we push though! 

I will be updating this hopefully every day (I am bad at pushing projects sometimes) 
but I am 100% been doing at least an hour every day, thats my challenge, and hour a day, and tbh its mostly been 2 hours.
I will try and do a LONG 6 hour dive into the boot cmap to catch my bootcamp projects up with my challenge days (keep yall updated) 
and you can follow my Twitter @boredSoloDev where I am making a daily post (most days lol) about what Im getting done


enjoy!
