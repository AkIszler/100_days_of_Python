Welcome to my GitHub page documenting my 100-days of code Challange! This repository serves as a log for my progress, showcasing the projects, exercises, and concepts I've worked on during this exciting challenge. I am currently mostly using python for most of the challenge, but I will be doing SOME javascript that will be put into a single project that I will try and finish at the very end of the challenge!!

## Disclaimer

I have been using [This Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM3@chw2g2r-zWk830Q8wLmu4PzHONQ9hDf99MhVhBYw_7zV-eBQwi34k2ZasJ7Q9vtIZA==/) to give me some sort of a guide, but the listed folders are days on the course and not days on the challenge, if that makes sense, Ill be updating the readme with the actual day, every 5 days or so I start work on a Javascript project that I want to upload at the very end of the challenge, Python to keep me coding and javascript to help me learn web development!!


## <center>Introduction</center>

During the next 100 days, I will be dedicating myself to mastering Python and expanding my programming skills with Javascript. This journey will involve tackling various topics, such as:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and modules
- File handling and input/output operations
- Object-oriented programming
- Web development with Python frameworks
- Data manipulation and analysis
- And much more!

By the end of these 100 days, I aim to become proficient in Python and have a solid foundation in software development as well as web development, I want to try and build a javascript application, and have it link to a python backend, not for any real reason besides learning to mix and match different coding/programming languages!
